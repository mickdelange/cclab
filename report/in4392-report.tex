\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
WantCloud BV is an organisation with a large workload in blurring images.
One of the business processes in WantCloud requires large images to be blurred using a Gaussian blur.
This process is compute intensive, as Gaussian functions require complex calculations as well as reading and writing large amounts of data.

Currently, WantCloud has a single server running all of these tasks.
For applying the Gaussian blur, an image filtering implementation in Java by Jerry Huxtable is used.\footnote{http://huxtable.com/ip/filters/index.html}
The WantCloud server is experiencing heavy peak loads and sits idle for the rest of the day.
At peak moments clients need to wait for quite some time for the images to be processed, which is harmful for WantCloud's business.
Therefore, WantCloud wants to explore the option to utilise a cloud computing infrastructure to cope with high loads and be able to scale down with low loads.

This report will discuss the details of an exploration towards using Amazon EC2\footnote{http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/} as a solution to WantClouds needs.
The image processing system will be implemented on a dynamically scalable cluster of compute nodes.
This implementation is made available open source through GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/mickdelange/cclab}.
The performance, overhead, and scalability will be tested to compare to the current set-up using one machine.

In this report first an insight will be given into the background of the application and its requirements in Section \ref{sec:bg}.
After this the design of the cloud solution will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:system}, giving an insight in the implementation.
The designed system will be tested and evaluated in Section \ref{sec:eval}.
The results of the evaluation will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:discussion} and conclusions will be presented in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

% 4. Background on Application (recommended size: 0.5 pages):
% describe the application (1 paragraph) and its requirements (1-3 paragraphs, summarized in a table if needed).
\section{Background}
\label{sec:bg}
The application that WantCloud uses receives images from clients, to which a Gaussian blur needs to be applied.
These image files are uploaded, these files are processed by the WantCloud server, and the results are presented to the clients after completion.
Currently, WantCloud uses a single machine to process these images.
This machine has to process many image files at certain times and sits idle for most of the time.

WantCloud has decided to explore the option of using a cloud platform to handle these varying loads in a more efficient way.
This means that the explored solution should provide better performance, while keeping the resulting costs to a minimum.
More specifically, the application has to deal with the following requirements.

\subsection{Elasticity}
The application must automatically provision compute nodes, depending on the current workload.
This means that unused nodes should be released as they are no longer needed, and new nodes should be leased as soon as the workload increases.
No human input should be required to 
This requirement should result being able to handle peak loads better, while limiting costs for unused resources.

\subsection{Performance}
The application should automatically schedule tasks to compute nodes.
This means that tasks are assigned to available nodes, new nodes are started when needed, and unused nodes are released without human input.

\subsection{Reliability}
Furthermore, the application must be reliable, or fault tolerant.
This means that any problems that occur should be dealt with, without the need for human interference.
Nodes that crash, tasks that break or other problems that occur should be dealt with by the system automatically.

% a. Resource Management Architecture: describe the design of your system,
% including the inter-operation of the provisioning, allocation, reliability, and
% monitoring components (which correspond to the homonym features required
% by the WantCloud CTO).
% b. System Policies: describe the policies your system uses and supports. The latter
% may remain not implemented throughout your coursework, as long as you can
% explain how they can be supported in the future.
% c. (Optional, for bonus points, see Section F) Additional System Features:
% describe each additional feature of your system, one sub-section per feature.
\section{System Design}
\label{sec_system}
The system design is aimed at providing a simple platform to support the work that WantCloud wants to perform.
It is intended as a proof of concept, rather than a production ready solution.
With this in mind, the main design decision were made to comply with the requirements discussed in Section \ref{sec_bg}.
In this section the main aspects of the system design will be discussed: the architecture, resource management, and policies.

\subsection{Architecture Overview}
The architecture of this solution is kept very simple, it consists of Master and Worker nodes.
These nodes communicate to notify each other of new tasks and finished tasks.
% TODO: Mick create a visualisation of the architecture.

\subsubsection{Master}
The Master node manages the process, it handles the scheduling and assigns tasks to Worker nodes.
As a new task comes in to the Master node, it is added to its main queue and assigned to the first available Worker.
If no Worker nodes are available, a new node is started to handle the workload.
The Master is also responsible for keeping track of each Worker's queue.
Worker nodes do not maintain a queue themselves, but are rather assigned one task at a time.

\subsubsection{Worker}
Worker nodes perform the actual work.
These nodes receive tasks from the Master node, process them, and reply to the Master whenever a task is finished.
Worker nodes are not aware of the length of their queue, the Master node keeps track of this information.
This design choice was made to keep the Worker nodes as simple as possible and also allow for easy fault correction in case a Worker node crashes.

\subsubsection{Communication}
% TODO: Maria describe the communication between nodes

\subsection{Resource Management Architecture}
The resources used in this application are a number of EC2 instances.
For testing purposes the free \texttt{t2.micro} instances where used with an Ubuntu operating system.
Here we will discuss how the requirements set in Section \ref{sec_bg} can be satisfied by the designed architecture.
